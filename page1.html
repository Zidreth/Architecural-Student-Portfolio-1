        "Equilibrium" This project features a contrast between natural
         ideals such as nature, relationships, and commitment; and material 
         ideals such as infrastructure, modal connectivity, and advancement.
          This contrast is highlighted through the idea that balancing these principles will achieve a blooming and sustainable future.
          <br><br>Manifesto:
          <br>I believe that to secure a future that is sustainable and habitable we must always push forward. To do this advancements must come into place but we cannot forget about ourselves and each other. Infrastructure and technology can never surpass genuine human understanding and the value of human life, connections are what keep things running. During my creative process, I had a vision to showcase the pulling of the images that represented sustainability and longevity. However, it was only until the continuation of images piling onto each other that it simply made sense. This iterative process emphasizes the nature of design where an idea is never fully completed or realized, and how the process becomes a part of the design itself. Draining the colour from the infrastructure side is to highlight the idea that we must "recolour" or change the way we think about infrastructure and shift its course through design and iteration.
